Marissa Paragano,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marissaparagano/,"When people ask what my next job will be, I often tell them, “the role probably doesn’t exist yet.”<br><br>

That’s what I've learned to love about the digital space. You zig. It zags.<br><br>

My journey to digital started back in 2012 when I graduated GE's Financial Management Program; rather than following a century-long tradition of pursuing finance or accounting post-program, I went with my gut and took a sharp right turn into the then-infant digital space.<br><br>

At the time, I was half of a two person team tasked with building out GE Capital Retail Finance’s mobile credit application sites, dubbed mApply.<br><br>

By the time I left, 4 years had passed, GE Capital had IPO’ed its retail business to become Synchrony Financial, and we had collectively launched all but one (there’s always one…) of the company’s 20+ retail clients onto our mApply platform, providing millions of customers access to credit.<br><br>

A few other cool things happened during that time:<br><br>

I graduated NYU Stern with an MBA focused in Digital Marketing, and Entertainment, Media & Technology (and GE was cool enough to support my part-time pursuit of it);<br>

GE Capital Retail Finance launched its first Innovation Station, and its leadership team selected 17 lucky colleagues and me to drive innovation throughout the company as inaugural members;<br>

Synchrony gave me the go ahead to run not just the mobile credit platform (mApply), but also the desktop credit platform (eApply), effectively tripling my purview;<br>

I convinced leadership that we should destroy the e and mApply sites we’d spent years building, in favor of a single adaptive responsive digital apply (dApply) site;<br>

I also ran my first half marathon, and invested in my first multi-family property<br><br>


After Synchrony, I spent a year in SF leading product/digital marketing for a segment of CoreLogic, then headed back east to develop digital products for Goldman Sachs’s awesome new-ish consumer segment, Marcus. Today I help drive digital innovation at JPMorgan Chase.",marissaparagano@gmail.com
